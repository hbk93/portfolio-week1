    <p>The image above is that of the mythical bird Phoenix. It is a representation of resilience and rebirth. <br>
    Starting this Software Development journey, I hope to be tempered and become better at programming.<br>
    Also, it is a representation of my mantra, <strong>be postively unstoppable.</strong>
